## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep ochre (#C2B280) to echo the specified light ochre, but darker and with increased contrast so it can work as a main color.
- Background color: Pale light ochre (#F5F5DC), very close to white, but retaining the warm tint specified by the user.
- Accent color: Soft gold (#D4AF37) to highlight premium details such as buttons, icons, and borders.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter content chunks; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Poppins' gives the interface a modern, geometric look, and is great for titles; 'PT Sans' has better legibility in longer form.
- Mobile-first design with a bottom sticky navigation bar featuring icons and labels (Home, Book, Consult, Social).
- Incorporate smooth micro-animations on hover states, button presses, and section transitions for enhanced UX.
